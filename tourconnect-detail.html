                        <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
                         <p>TourConnect is an online, global community for the B2B tourism/travel industry. TourConnect can help you make new business partners, stay connected with your current partners, and TourConnect also have tools to help make doing business easier - like automating the annual contracting process. In simpler terms, TourConnect has two main functions, One is help user find new partners or current partners, the another is help you build e-contract with your partners.<br><br>I was joined TourConnect as a UX designer. My work include new features development and redesign the existing product to improve a better experience for user. I focus on streamlines product workflow and design doable solutions. I am the only designer in TourConnect team so I was responsible for whole design process including research, use-case analysis, user feedback review, user flow design, prototyping and user interface design. </p>

                        <p>There're two biggest challenges I met in TourConnect products design process. The first one is how to quickly understand and grasp the TourConnect product. The B2B product is much complex than before.</p>

                        <p>After rounds of ideation and refine, our final design divided our target users into five categorise, and customized the new user flows related their scenarios and primary goals. More specifically, we redefined the user categories and identified users' goals at sign up，regrouped informations and guided them by bubble box to complete their company profile in order to accomplish their primary goal. We also cooperated with trigger email to encourage users to make their profile more pretty. The new user flows incredibly reduced the information input time and operation steps. Additional, they enhanced the product usability to make users don’t need to think about how to use our product.</p>
