                        <p>I was redesign the search page at the beginning because of I thought the main problem was the bad experience on search partner page.Through the research I found the problem was not only caused by search partner page. So I was changed my original idea.</p>

                        <p>After rounds of ideation and refine, our final design divided our target users into five categorise, and customized the new user flows related their scenarios and primary goals. More specifically, we redefined the user categories and identified users' goals at sign up，regrouped informations and guided them by bubble box to complete their company profile in order to accomplish their primary goal. We also cooperated with trigger email to encourage users to make their profile more pretty. The new user flows incredibly reduced the information input time and operation steps. Additional, they enhanced the product usability to make users don’t need to think about how to use our product.</p>
